		<h1>JTBD</h1>
		JTBD is a framework for disruption and innovation created by Clay Christensen, professor at Harvard Business School and famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y">milkshake magician</a>. 
		<p>It goes beyond general user needs and goals and dives into the details of your user's decision making process for selecting, using, and continuing to use products.</p>
		<h2>When do I use JTBD?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>when you already have a deep understanding of your users</li>
			<li>when a user’s demographics / specific domain details are not as important as the user’s moment-to-moment context</li>
			<li>when you need to drill into context to create a better tool</li>
			<li>when you want to determine where to focus your product based on market factors, not just user need</li>
			<li>when you want to look at forces around product adoption</li>
			<li>when you want to be disruptive</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>JTBD and Personas</h2>
		Ah, JTBD and personas. Which should you use? Which is better? This question often comes up.
		<p>It's important to be aware that there has been some unkind history between the JTBD community and folks who use personas. While browsing resources online, you may come across some articles that still violently harpoon personas in an effort to champion jobs. (Everyone may also have a different definition of persona - different from the original Cooper definition.)</p>
		<p>JTBD is just another tool in the toolkit, however. Think of it as another framework that you can learn to help with some projects. There is no reason that JTBD and personas cannot both be used on a project. In fact, all it means is that you would understand the fuller dimension of your user (persona) AND focus on what that user wants from your tool. Sounds like a great way to build a product!</p>
		<p>Use your judgment to determine whether to bring in personas and/or jobs for your project, and how you introduce the relevant exercises. To answer the original question, you can use one, either, both -- or none! It depends. Each offers you a different lens with which to view your product and its users. As you use JTBD and personas in your practice, you will understand the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, and perhaps develop a preference for using one more often in certain situations. As with other tools, there is no all-or-nothing blanket answer on which to use. It depends on your needs and context :)</p>

				<td>Projects where building different personas directly impacts what you build. For example, 1-2 distinct personas who would use your product differently.</td>
				<td>Projects with many different users who use the product to fulfill the same purpose. For example, a consumer product where the demographics and other segmentation of users have little to no impact on the final product.</td>
