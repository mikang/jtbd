		<h1>JTBD</h1>
		JTBD is a framework for disruption and innovation created by Clay Christensen, professor at Harvard Business School and famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y">milkshake magician</a>. 
		<p>It goes beyond general user needs and goals and dives into the details of your user's decision making process for selecting, using, and continuing to use products.</p>
		<h2>When do I use JTBD?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>when you already have a deep understanding of your users</li>
			<li>when a user’s demographics / specific domain details are not as important as the user’s moment-to-moment context</li>
			<li>when you need to drill into context to create a better tool</li>
			<li>when you want to determine where to focus your product based on market factors, not just user need</li>
			<li>when you want to look at forces around product adoption</li>
			<li>when you want to be disruptive</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>JTBD and Personas</h2>
		Using both JTBD and personas can be a challenge. While browsing resources online, you may come across some that champion JTBD and harpoon personas. But they serve different goals and are not interchangeable. Use your judgment to determine what works best for your project, whether you should one or both, and when.

			<tr>
				<td class="category"><h3>Goal</h3></td>
				<td>Build empathy</td>
				<td>Focus on the specific task(s) that your user is trying to accomplish in a certain <b>context</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="category"><h3>How?</h3></td>
				<td>Provide high-level needs and goals that help you understand your user's overall motivations, and help you take into account the differences among those who may use your product</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="category"><h3>Best Used</h3></td>
				<td>Projects with defined user roles and/or unique domain knowledge</td>
				<td>Projects with many different users who want to accomplish the same task and/or with users whose demographics are similar or have little to no impact on the final product. Especially deadly for products trying to find product/market fit, trying to carve out a new niche for itself in the competitive landscape, and/or products with barriers to adoption outside the tool itself</td>

		<h2>Tips</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Write out the JTBD activity templates on large white easel pad paper. Before you start interviews, review them with your team, so they know what the end result will be. This helps to frame the research goals and focus questions during the interviews.</li>
			<li>Understand the scope of your project, and wield JTBD accordingly. If you are deciding what specific features to build within an already defined scope, you can use JTBD on a more feature-level (with awareness of this). If you are helping a team innovate, reach new markets, or rethink their current market, you can brainstorm higher-level jobs that drill into context and psychological motivations behind user actions. In this case, expand JTBD and take advantage of its fullest capacities by brainstorming all possible competitors for your job(s), and out-of-the-box ways you can tackle them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Example Projects</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Project 1: We had 2 personas with distinct roles (admin vs. admin support), 1 clear job, unique and unfamiliar domain (to consultant team), and many forces against product adoption. 
					<ul><li>Process: Interviews, Individual Synthesis, Group Synthesis, Jobs, Personas, Four Forces, Job Scenario</li></ul>
				</li>
				<li>Project 2: We had many demographically diverse personas (but whose demographics did not impact the job), LOTS of jobs, and LOTS of competitors. We also had a thorough understanding of the users. In this case, the users were employees of Pivotal Labs :) </li>
					<ul><li>Process: Interviews, Individual Synthesis, Jobs. We constantly discussed user needs and pain points, but we did not go through a full persona building exercise.</li></ul>
				</li>
				<li>Project 3: We have 2-3 personas with distinct roles, 1 clear job (with many features), unique and unfamiliar space (to consultant team), and an existing product validated through 20+ years of use.</li>
					<ul><li>Process: Personas, Interviews, Individual Synthesis, and we will see about JTBD :)</li></ul>
				</li>
